Here's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   A clean and intuitive calendar view displaying days, weeks, or months.\n-   The ability to add, edit, and delete events with details like title, date, time, location, and description.\n-   A mechanism for automatic updates, potentially integrating with external calendar services (this might require Supabase or other backend services).\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    -   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    -   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    -   Primary: `#3F51B5` (Indigo, a calming and professional color)\n    -   Secondary: `#E91E63` (Pink, for highlights and calls to action)\n    -   Accent: `#03A9F4` (Light Blue, for interactive elements)\n    -   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White, for content containers)\n    -   Highlight: `#FFEB3B` (Yellow, for selected dates or important events)\n-   **Typography:**\n    -   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for the platform) or \"Roboto\" for a professional and readable look.\n\nHere's the plan for the coding agent:\n\n1.  **Create a basic calendar UI:** Start with a simple calendar view in `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` using components like `FlatList` to display days in a month.\n2.  **Implement event handling:** Add functionality to add, edit, and delete events. This might involve creating a new component for event details and using state management to store events.\n3.  **Implement the design elements:** Apply the specified colors and typography to the calendar UI and event details component.\n4.  **Remove modal demos:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it's not relevant to the calendar app.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the app will have a basic calendar UI with event handling and a clean, modern design.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-10T14:15:52.632968"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a digital calendar app (calendario digitale) that can be automatically updated.
